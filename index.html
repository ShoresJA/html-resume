        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            With over 8 years of experience in the customer service industry, I 
            have honed my skills in communication, problem-solving, and customer relations. 
            I excel at understanding and addressing client needs, ensuring a positive 
            experience. Currently, I am expanding my expertise by training as a full stack 
            web developer, combining my strong background in client interaction with new 
            technical skills to deliver innovative, user-focused solutions. This blend of 
            experience allows me to bring both a customer-centric and a technical perspective 
            to any project.
